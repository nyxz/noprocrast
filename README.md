Go to the [GitHub Page of the project](https://nyxz.github.io/noprocrast).

The project is inspired by a [TED Talk: Inside the mind of a master procrastinator by Tim Urban](https://www.ted.com/talks/tim_urban_inside_the_mind_of_a_master_procrastinator?language=en). It's a fun talk - I recommend it. Spoiler alert: In the talk you will see the "calendar" that this project is all about.
